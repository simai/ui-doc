# Reverse conversion (from pixels to alphanumeric)

1. **Determine the zone**:  
   Suppose we have 56px.  
   Look at the thresholds: 56 > 40 and < 80, so it's in zone D.

2. **Subtract the start value**:  
   For D it's 40, so we get 56–40 = 16.

3. **Divide by the multiplier**:  
   The multiplier for D is 4.  
   16 ÷ 4 = 4 → so the value is `d4`.
