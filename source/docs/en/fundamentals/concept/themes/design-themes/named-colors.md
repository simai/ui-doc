# Named colors

Within a given theme, you can use the following named colors:

- `.color-primary` — main text color
- `.color-secondary` — secondary text color
- `.color-hint` — hint/minor text color
- `.c-icon-active` — active icon color
- `.c-icon-inactive` — inactive icon color
- `.b-divider` — divider (border) color

Depending on the selected theme (light or dark), these classes automatically adapt to the color scheme of that theme.
