# Global variables

Global variables are defined in the framework core and are used across all its components and plugins. Their names are
formed according to the pattern: `--sf-{value}`

**Examples:**

* `--sf-color-primary` — the main framework color.
* `--sf-breakpoint-lg` — the breakpoint for large screens.
