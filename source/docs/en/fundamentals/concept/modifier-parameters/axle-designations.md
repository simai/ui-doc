# Axis notation

The following abbreviations are used to denote axes:

1. `x` — horizontal axis.
2. `y` — vertical axis.
3. `main` — main axis (used for flexboxes and grids).
4. `cross` — cross axis (used for flexboxes and grids).

The axis notation is added with a hyphen after the property name. In most cases, the horizontal (`x`) and vertical (`y`) axes are used when working with elements, while `main` and `cross` are used in the context of flexboxes and grids.
