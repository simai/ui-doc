# Color

In the current version of SIMAI Framework, a more flexible and logical color management system is implemented. Unlike previous versions that used a fixed color palette to build modifiers and UI elements, there is now a unified token-based color scheme.

A **color scheme** is a set of tokens built from color primitives according to specific rules. These tokens are used in design and when creating modifiers, which simplifies working with colors, reduces the number of color modifiers, and makes their usage clearer and more structured.

The framework supports two main color themes: **light** and **dark**, ensuring versatility and adaptation of the interface to different conditions.
