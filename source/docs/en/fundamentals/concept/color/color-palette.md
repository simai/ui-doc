# Color palette

The color palette includes the following main groups of colors: **Primary**, **Secondary**, **Tertiary**, **Error**, **Success**, as well as three additional tone-less colors — transparent, white, and black.

The palette generation system is based on the HCT (Hue, Chroma, Tone) color scheme used in Material Design 3\.
The approach to generating tones is similar to the Material Design 3 documentation (details: [Material Design Color System](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/overview)).
For each color, a set of 16 tones is used: 98, 95, 90, 85, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5\.
Tones 100 and 0 are replaced with white and black respectively.
