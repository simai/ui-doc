# A new approach to using color

SIMAI Framework uses an updated approach to color management inspired by Google Material 3 concepts, but adapted for web projects.
The changes take web development specifics into account, simplifying the implementation of element states without adding extra layers, as is done in Material 3\.

A key difference is the use of three main accent colors: **primary**, **secondary**, and **tertiary**, rather than a single one as in traditional schemes.
This makes it possible to build a more flexible visual hierarchy:

* **Primary** — a saturated color for the most important, attention‑demanding elements. It’s recommended to use it sparingly — no more than one key element per screen.
* **Secondary** — a muted variant of primary for repeating elements such as menus, list buttons, or tabs.
* **Tertiary** — an accent color for elements that differ from the main ones. It helps draw attention to important details without overpowering the primary accent.

This approach to accents creates a harmonious hierarchy and makes interfaces easier for users to perceive.
