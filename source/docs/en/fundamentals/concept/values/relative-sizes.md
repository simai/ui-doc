# Relative sizes

Relative sizes are set as fractions to define size relative to the parent element or the screen:

1. For 100% the keyword `full` is used, for example: `w-full`.
2. Sizes relative to the screen are denoted with the `screen` prefix: `h-screen-1/2`, `h-screen-3/4`.
3. For grids, `fr` is used to denote a fraction of the remaining space, for example: `auto-cols-fr`, `auto-rows-fr`.
