# Proportional values

Proportional values change relative to each other. Examples of such values include text sizes and spacings. These
values depend on the device: desktops and mobile devices can have different parameters.

1. For example: `m-0`, `p-0` for zero values.
2. The value increases or decreases depending on the property magnitude in order to preserve proportionality.
