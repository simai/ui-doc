# Absolute dimensions

The main unit of measurement is `rem`, which allows you to build adaptive interfaces that adjust to the fonts used.
Within the framework, a system of absolute dimensions is used to define all fixed values in order to ensure consistency
and harmony in the interface.

1. Sizes are designated with values such as `w-0`, `w-px` (where `px` equals 1 pixel).
2. For negative values, a minus sign (`-`) is added before the modifier, for example: `-m-2`, `-left-a4`.
