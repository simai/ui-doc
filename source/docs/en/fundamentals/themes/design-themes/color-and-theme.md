# Color and theme

Theme colors are based on black and white with transparency, so they look good on colored backgrounds too.

```html
<section class="theme-light bg-danger-tonal">
    <p class="color-primary">Primary text</p>
    <p class="color-secondary">Secondary text</p>
    <p class="color-hint">Hint text</p>
    <span class="c-icon-active">Active icon</span>
    <span class="c-icon-inactive">Inactive icon</span>
    <div class="b-divider m-top-1">Divider</div>
</section>
```
