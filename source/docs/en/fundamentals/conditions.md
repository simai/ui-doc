# Modifier conditions

SIMAI Framework modifiers let you adapt element styles based on various conditions. This helps tailor the interface to different viewport sizes and element states, keeping it responsive and user-friendly.

Conditions define when a modifier becomes active. They are added before the modifier and separated by a colon (:). SIMAI Framework provides two types of conditions:

* Adaptivity conditions — apply when the viewport width matches a breakpoint, allowing styles to adjust to devices and screen sizes.
* State conditions — change styles based on element state (for example, hover or focus).

Conditions let modifiers adapt to diverse scenarios, providing a flexible, modular styling system. Adaptivity conditions are closely tied to breakpoints that define screen ranges and help control interface responsiveness.
