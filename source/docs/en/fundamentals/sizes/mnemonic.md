# Mnemonic for quick recall

- Thresholds: B ~ 10, C ~ 20, D ~ 40, E ~ 80, F ~ 160 (each next about 2× larger).
- Multipliers: B = ×1, C = ×2, D = ×4, E = ×8, F = ×16…
- Example:
    - A — just pixels (a4 = 4px)
    - B — base ~10, then + digit × 1
    - C — ~20 + digit × 2
    - D — ~40 + digit × 4
    - E — ~80 + digit × 8
    - And so on in powers of two.

Knowing the base thresholds and multipliers makes mental conversion easier.
