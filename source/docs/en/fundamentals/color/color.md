# Color

The current version of SIMAI Framework introduces a more flexible and intuitive color system. Unlike previous releases,
which relied on fixed color palettes for modifiers and UI components, it now uses a unified token-based scheme.

**Color scheme** describes a collection of tokens generated from color primitives following defined rules. These tokens
are applied throughout the design system and modifier creation, simplifying color work, reducing modifier clutter, and
making usage more transparent and structured.

The framework supports two main themes—**light** and **dark**—so the interface adapts well to different environments.
