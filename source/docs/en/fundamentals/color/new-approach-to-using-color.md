# New approach to using color

SIMAI Framework applies an updated color strategy inspired by Google Material 3, adapted for the web. The changes account
for web specifics, simplifying state handling without adding extra layers like in Material 3.

Key difference: three accent colors — **primary**, **secondary**, **tertiary** — instead of one. This builds a more
flexible visual hierarchy:

* **Primary** — saturated color for the most critical elements; use sparingly (ideally one key element per screen).
* **Secondary** — a subdued primary shade for repeated elements (menus, list buttons, tabs).
* **Tertiary** — an accent for elements that differ from the main ones, highlighting details without overshadowing the
  main accent.

This accent approach creates a harmonious hierarchy and makes interfaces easier to perceive.
