# Color palette

The palette contains main groups: **Primary**, **Secondary**, **Tertiary**, **Error**, **Success**, plus three without
tones — transparent, white, black.

Palette generation is based on the HCT model (Hue, Chroma, Tone) from Material Design 3. Tone generation follows MD3’s
approach ([Material Design Color System](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/overview)). Each color uses these 16
tones: 98, 95, 90, 85, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5. Tones 100 and 0 are replaced by white and black
respectively.
