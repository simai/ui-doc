# Playground

Fast ways to try modifiers without deploying a project:

- Embedded frames from [play.simai.io](https://play.simai.io) — copy examples and tweak modifiers right in the browser.
- Enable `sf-playground` on any page and paste demo code from the [Utilities](../utilities/index.md) section.
- For local experiments, keep your `webpack.mix.js`/`vite` config handy and rebuild after class changes.

If something does not work, check network asset loading and compare with the [project setup](project-setup.md).
