# Quickstart

A short route for your first steps:

1. Connect CSS and JS as described in [Installation](installation.md).
2. Open any example from the [Playground](playground.md) and copy the markup.
3. Add a few basic modifiers (spacing, colors, typography) and check responsiveness across breakpoints.

Next, move on to [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md) to learn grids and breakpoints for building responsive interfaces.
