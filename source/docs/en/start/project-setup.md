# Project setup

Recommended order for a working environment:

1. Sync framework and utility dependencies (Composer/NPM) and check the bundler versions.
2. Keep a basic `resources`/`public` structure with asset paths expected by the loader.
3. Enable linters and formatting for Blade/Markdown so examples from the docs match your project style.
4. Set up a dev server with hot reload to quickly verify modifiers and utilities.

After configuration, proceed to [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md) and adjust the [Loader](loader/index.md) for your environment.
