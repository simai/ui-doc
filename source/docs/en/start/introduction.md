# Introduction

This section helps you quickly spin up SF UI and understand what to do next. Start with installation, then try ready-made examples in the playground, and proceed to project setup.

- [Installation](installation.md) — basic steps to connect UI Utilities.
- [Quickstart](quickstart.md) — a short route through the first components and modifiers.
- [Playground](playground.md) — links to interactive examples and ways to run them.
- [Project setup](project-setup.md) — structure, environment, and useful commands.
- [Loader](loader/index.md) — SFLoader architecture and settings.

After starting, continue with [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md) and the [Utilities reference](../utilities/index.md).
