# Color roles

SIMAI Framework uses an extended approach to color roles based on the principles of Material Design (more details:
[Material Design Color Roles](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/roles)). In the current version, the approach is
expanded to simplify usage in web development.

Roles can be divided into several categories:

1. **Base roles** — can be used on their own.
2. **Auxiliary roles** — extend base roles by adding extra properties.
3. **Interactive roles** — reflect user interaction with elements.
4. **Special roles** — intended for specific tasks.
