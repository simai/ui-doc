# Supporting roles

* **Container** — role for the background of small areas (notifications, interface elements).
* **On** — roles starting with "On" specify the color of text and icons on the background of the parent color. For
  example, "On Primary" for text on top of `Primary`.
* **Variant** — roles ending with "Variant" provide a less contrastive alternative to the main role. For example,
  `outline-variant` is a less contrastive version of an outline.
* **Transparent** — role for interactive elements with a transparent background (for example, when hovering over a link
  button).
* **Overlay** — a background role with a semi-transparent color used for additional accenting of the background on top
  of other background roles (surface, container).
