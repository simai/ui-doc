# Additional themes

In the future, the set of themes can be expanded, for example for users with low vision or to create high-contrast
color schemes. In this case, colors are redefined to a preprepared set of variables. For example, for a black-and-white
scheme all colors are replaced with shades of gray, similar to `neutral-grey`.
