# Outline

The **Outline** role is used for styling outlines, borders, and dividers of interface elements, providing clear
structuring of visual space.

Outline role variations:

* **Outline** — the base outline for form elements: buttons, inputs, checkboxes, switches, and other interactive
  components. It provides clear boundaries without drawing excessive attention.
* **Outline Variant** — a softened, lighter outline, ideal for use as a divider or border of larger areas, menus, or
  sections. This variant creates a less noticeable but still discernible visual boundary.
