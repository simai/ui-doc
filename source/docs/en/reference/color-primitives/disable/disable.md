# Disable

The **Disable** role is intended to visually indicate inactive or locked interface elements. Its use helps clearly
communicate to the user that a given element is not available for interaction.

Disable role variations:

* **Disable** — background fill for inactive elements that reduces contrast and thus indicates their inaccessibility.
* **On Disable** — text and icons optimized for clear display on the Disable color background. Used when an element
  with text or icons becomes inactive.
* **Outline Disable** — a less contrastive color for borders and outlines of inactive elements, indicating their
  inaccessibility without drawing extra attention.
