# Components

This section is in progress. It will contain UI component descriptions, usage examples, and guidance on integrating them with utilities.

Planned materials:

- Core interface components (buttons, cards, forms).
- Complex widgets and patterns.
- Practical examples of setup and configuration.

Stay tuned — the section will expand as documentation is prepared.
