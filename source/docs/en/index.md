# Introduction

**SIMAI Framework UI Utilities** is a toolkit focused on simplifying and accelerating the creation of responsive,
modular, and maintainable interfaces. As an addition to the core SIMAI Framework, this package provides developers with
a rich set of modifiers to control typography, spacing, color palettes, grids, flex containers, and other visual
elements. The goal is to deliver flexibility and design consistency while keeping a unified approach to layout.

This document collects an overview of **UI Utilities** capabilities, recommendations for integrating them into existing
projects, and practical usage examples. You will learn how to apply these tools for rapid prototyping, improving code
readability, and maintaining a consistent style as interfaces scale. Ultimately, this helps optimize workflows and boost
the quality of the products you build.
